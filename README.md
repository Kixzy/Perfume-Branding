## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I did this project after not opening my system for a week, I was quite rusty, I doubted I could do it without watching a tutorial video to refresh my brain to tailwind css. And I am about transitioning into Javascript proper. It was an easy one, I knew it was, but I was bland and blank at the time. However, I found courage to keep going. That is what this project has taught me, to keep going, no giving up.

### Continued development

I think I still need to do more work to develop more. I still could not use the right font family. I settled for what came easy. Promise that will be my main focus, learning how to insert font family in tailwind css.

### Useful resources

It was basically I and tailwind in this one.
